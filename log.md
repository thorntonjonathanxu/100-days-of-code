# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jonathan Thornton

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 03/16/2022.

## Log

### Day 1: 
For my first project for this challenge, I'd like to review some of the open-source data sources that are available and general effective and appear visualizations using only python libraries/extensions. 

I implemented a simple request API request to pull down the records related to safety information and tried to map out bar charts and distribution content for categorical data including age and gender. Had issues trying to map neighborhood and lat/log data but will pursue this in the coming days as I work through this content. 

Applicable Source Data:

### Day 2:
Today I wanted to focus on the aspects of categorizing data and displaying that information with matplotlib. Was able to build out a few pivot tables to show the breakdown by neighbor and built simple dataframe calls to display the content for age, gender, and neighborhood. 

I also inserted the mass data dump for the CSV file which I’ll use for my overall dataset now that I have general familiarization of the data. Am interested in refining the API call to grab the most current result-set every x number of days and determine where I’ll store this information in the longer term.
